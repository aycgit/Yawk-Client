# Yawk-Client
A modded Minecraft Hacked Client for version 1.8

The Minecraft source code has been hidden from this repository for copyright reasons, however you can download the full source code here (accurate as of commit #180):
http://yawk.net/downloads/Yawk%20Client%20Source.rar

This project uses modified code from DarkMagician6's Event API: https://bitbucket.org/DarkMagician6/eventapi
Unfortunately this has to be done through direct editing due to how the Event API works so you'll find the modified version on this repository.

This project has the following dependencies:
* Jsoup 1.8.1: http://jsoup.org/
* Netted by 10askinsw (unreleased and optional for certain available plugins)

Appreciated help:
* Thanks to Arnold for helping to co-develop the client
* Thanks to Sparks for some tips on the event api
* Thanks to LordPankake for getting me to change the mod system and other tips
* Thanks to Temper for the ReflectionUtils class
* Thanks to Opim10 for the Yggdrasil authenticator
* Thanks to Jonalu and Godshawk for the LWJGL Scissor util class
